Poker AI

In the realm of artificial intelligence, few domains pose a greater challenge than the intricate game of poker. Renowned for its blend of strategic decision-making, probabilistic reasoning, and psychological warfare, poker stands as a benchmark for assessing the capabilities of intelligent systems. The development of advanced poker AI agents capable of competing with, or even surpassing, human expertise has captivated researchers and enthusiasts alike. Due to its nature of incomplete information from the point of view of the players, developing a sophisticated artificial intelligence for poker requires much more computing power and complexity as compared to complete information strategy games even such as chess. Poker bots today endeavors to best simulate a skilled human poker player in Heads Up No Limit Hold’em (NLHE), which is a variation of poker including two players playing one on one on the No Limit Hold’em version with poker with each other, employing an algorithm centered around Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) whereby the agent, through recursively regret matching in a series of offline self-play iterations, converges towards optimal strategies. Because of its nature where the decisions that are available to each player at any stages of the game are identical, this means that there must exist a Nash equilibrium. The existence of this equilibrium means that it is theoretically possible to exist a strategy for both players where deviation from the strategy is undesirable as it provides other players the opportunity to exploit them. Therefore, it is our goal with this project to develop a Poker bot for Heads Up No Limit Texas Holdem that searches for this equilibrium.
